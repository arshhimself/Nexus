Hi {{ name }},

Congratulations! You’ve been selected as an L0 Contributor for Nexus, the Open Source community of RCOE Computer Science department. We’re glad to have you aboard!

We will schedule the first introductory meeting very soon — keep an eye on your inbox for meeting details and the invitation link.

"The most important skill in open source isn’t coding — it’s communication." — Karl Fogel, author of Producing Open Source Software

As open source demands clear communication and consistent participation, we’d be happy if you attend as many meets as possible.

Warm regards,
Team Nexus
